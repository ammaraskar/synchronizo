\chapter{Sprint Overview}
The work done in this sprint will complete the social networking aspect of our application. By the end of this sprint users will be able to follow/un-follow other users and interact with each other through direct messages and by displaying their recent taste in music. Another large portion of this sprint will be dedicated to giving admin privileges to certain accounts and keeping statistics by user on the certain types of music they listen to. 

\begin{description}
\item[Scrum Master] Abhijeet Chakrabarti

\item[Meeting Plan] Meeting on Fridays and Saturdays in Hillenbrand lobby.

\item[Risks And Challenges] The biggest risk/challenge associated with this sprint will be the implementation of admin users and listener metrics. Altering the permissions of a user to gain control over other users may prove challenging and keeping track of users' tastes in music by genre may require some algorithmic development to identify genre by songs a user has uploaded/listened to.
